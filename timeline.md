12-Hour Project Timeline
Hour 0–1: Planning & Environment Setup
Define Scope & Priorities:
Identify must-have functionalities: blockchain connectivity, simple rule-based fraud detection, escrow simulation, wallet integration, and a basic dashboard.

Set Up Development Environment:
Initialize your repository, create a virtual environment, and install required libraries (e.g., web3.py, Streamlit).

Hour 1–3: Core Module Implementation (Blockchain & Wallet Integration)
Blockchain Integration:

Connect to a blockchain testnet node using web3.py.

Implement a basic listener to capture pending transactions.

Wallet Functions:

Integrate a simple wallet simulation to sign and send transactions.

Set up functions to simulate flagging transactions.

Hour 3–5: Fraud Detection & Escrow Service Implementation
Fraud Detection (Rule-Based):

Develop a straightforward rule-based anomaly detection mechanism (e.g., flag transactions over a threshold amount or from suspicious addresses).

Test this module using simulated or historical data.

Escrow Service Module:

Create a simple escrow simulation in Python (using data structures to manage fund states).

Implement logic for locking funds and releasing them based on pre-set conditions (manual trigger or time-based).

Hour 5–8: Streamlit Dashboard Development
UI Design & Setup:

Build the Streamlit dashboard layout to display real-time transaction data.

Create panels for flagged transactions and escrow status.

Module Integration:

Connect dashboard elements to your backend functions.

Add interactive controls for triggering wallet actions and manually flagging transactions.

Hour 8–10: Integration & End-to-End Testing
Module Integration:

Combine blockchain monitoring, fraud detection, escrow service, and wallet functions.

Ensure the dashboard reflects updates from the backend in real time.

Testing & Debugging:

Simulate transaction flows to validate anomaly detection and escrow operations.

Address integration issues and debug critical errors.

Hour 10–11: Final Testing & Refinement
Comprehensive Testing:

Run end-to-end tests (simulate blockchain events and wallet actions) to ensure smooth operation.

Add basic error handling and logging for stability.

Polishing:

Refine UI elements and streamline interactions on the dashboard.

Hour 11–12: Final Touches & Demo Preparation
User Interface & Documentation:

Polish the dashboard for clarity and usability.

Document key functions and add inline comments.

Demo Setup:

Prepare a brief walkthrough highlighting blockchain integration, fraud detection in action, and escrow functionality.

Test the demo flow to ensure all modules perform as expected.
