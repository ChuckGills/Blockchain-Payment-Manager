## Overview

The Decentralized Payment Protector monitors blockchain transactions to detect fraudulent activity *before* confirmations occur. By integrating with a wallet interface, users can flag suspicious transactions and safely handle funds via an escrow mechanism. Built in Python with a focus on decentralization, this tool leverages real-time data and a streamlined dashboard powered by Streamlit.

## Features

- **Blockchain Integration:** Connects to a blockchain testnet node, monitors pending and confirmed transactions.
- **Fraud Detection:** Implements a rule-based anomaly detection system to flag potentially fraudulent transactions based on predefined criteria.
- **Escrow Service:** Simulates or deploys a smart contract-based escrow service for secure, conditional fund transfers.
- **Wallet Integration:** Enables users to link wallets, sign transactions, and flag suspicious payments directly.
- **Real-Time Dashboard:** A Streamlit interface for visualizing flagged transactions, escrow statuses, and interactive controls.
